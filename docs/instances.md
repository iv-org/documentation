10. Any system whose goal is to modify the content served to the user (i.e web server HTML rewrite) is considered the same as modifying the source code.
11. Instances running a modified source code:

13. Instances MUST NOT restrict or disallow the access / usage to any [natural person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_person) (e.g. a country's IP range MUST NOT be blocked, access by a natural person MUST NOT be disallowed for arbitrary reason) - this rule doesn't apply to [juridical persons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juridical_person).

**NOTE:** We reserve the right to decline any instance from being added to the list, and to remove / ban any instance breaking the aforementioned rules.
