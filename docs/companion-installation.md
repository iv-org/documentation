# Temporary installation guide for Invidious companion 

After installation take a look at the [Post-install steps](#post-install-configuration).

Note: Any [PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) or [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) provider/software (Heroku, YunoHost, Repli...) are unsupported. Use them at your own risk. They **WILL** cause problems with Invidious and might even suspend your account for "abuse" since Invidious is heavy, bandwidth intensive and technically a proxy (and most providers don't like them). If you use one and want to report an issue, please mention which one you use.

# WARNING about this doc

This documentation is temporary and will explain you how to test Invidious companion. Invidious companion is currently in testing in the master branch.

And if you are using a reverse proxy then make sure to read again the post install because you have new routes to add!

## Hardware requirements

Running Invidious requires at least 20GB disk space, 512MB of free RAM (so ~2G installed on the system), as long as it is restarted regularly, as recommended in the post-install configuration. Public instances should ideally have at least 60G disk space, 4GB of RAM, 2vCPU, a 200 mbps link and 20TB of traffic (no data cap/unlimited traffic is preferred).

Compiling Invidious requires at least 2.5GB of free RAM (We recommend to have at least 4GB installed).
If you have less (e.g on a cheap VPS) you can setup a SWAP file or partition, so the combined amount is >= 4GB.

You need at least 1GB of RAM for the machine that will run the tool `youtube-trusted-session-generator` in the 1st step. Doesn't need to be the same machine as the one running Invidious, just a machine running on the same public IP address.

## Docker

**The Invidious docker image is only [available on Quay](https://quay.io/repository/invidious/invidious) because, unlike Docker Hub, [Quay is Free and Open Source Software](https://github.com/quay/quay/blob/master/LICENSE). This is reflected in the `docker-compose.yml` file used in this walk-through.**

Ensure [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install) are installed before beginning.

### Docker-compose method (production)

**This method uses the pre-built Docker image from quay**

Note: Currently the repository has to be cloned, this is because the `init-invidious-db.sh` file and the `config/sql` directory have to be mounted to the postgres container (See the volumes section in the docker-compose file below). This "problem" will be solved in the future.

Make sure to run the newer Docker Compose V2: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/. It should already be installed if you can successfully run the command `docker compose` (with a space between the two words).


1.  Execute these commands:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/iv-org/invidious.git
    cd invidious
    ```

2.  Generate two secret keys, one for Invidious (HMAC_KEY) and one for Invidious companion (invidious_companion_key)
    ```bash
    pwgen 16 1 # for Invidious (HMAC_KEY)
    pwgen 16 1 # for Invidious companion (invidious_companion_key)
    ```

3.  Edit the docker-compose.yml with this content:

    ```docker
    version: "3"
    services:

      invidious:
        image: quay.io/invidious/invidious:master
        # image: quay.io/invidious/invidious:master-arm64 # ARM64/AArch64 devices
        restart: unless-stopped

    volumes:
      postgresdata:

    ```

    Note: This compose is made for a true "production" setup, where Invidious is behind a reverse proxy. If you prefer to directly access Invidious, replace `127.0.0.1:3000:3000` with `3000:3000` under the `ports:` section.

4. Run the docker composition:

```
docker compose up -d
```


### Docker-compose method (development)

**This method builds a Docker image from source**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iv-org/invidious.git
cd invidious
docker-compose up
```


## Manual Installation

**Note:** Invidious currently supports the following Crystal versions: `1.10.x` / `1.11.x` / `1.12.x`. \
Versions `1.9.x` and older are incompatible because we use features only present in the newer versions. \
Versions `1.13.x` should be compatible, however we did not test it.

```

### Windows

Crystal, the programming language used by Invidious, [doesn't officially support Windows yet](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/issues/5430) but you can still install Invidious:

- By installing [Docker desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/) and then following [our guide about Docker](#docker).
- By installing [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about) and then following [our guide about Linux](#linux).
- By installing [Windows-specific builds](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/) of Crystal. Be wary, as we don't currently have records of Invidious being tested on those "unsupported" builds yet.

## Post-install configuration:

Detailed configuration available in the [configuration guide](./configuration.md).

You must set a random generated value for the parameter `hmac_key:`! On Linux you can generate it using the command `pwgen 20 1`.

Because of various issues, Invidious **must** be restarted often, at least once a day, ideally every hour.

If you use a reverse proxy, you **must** configure Invidious to properly serve request through it:

`https_only: true` : if you are serving your instance via https, set it to true

`domain: domain.ext`: if you are serving your instance via a domain name, set it here

`external_port: 443`: if you are serving your instance via https, set it to 443

`use_pubsub_feeds: true`: if you are serving your instance on the internet, allow for faster notification of new videos ([detailed explanation](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious/blob/97c4165f55c4574efb554c9dae8d919d08da1cdd/config/config.example.yml#L409)).

`use_innertube_for_captions: true`: if you are serving a public instance or you are hosting Invidious in a datacenter, allow to unblock captions ([detailed explanation](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious/issues/2567#issuecomment-1727928996)).

AND make sure to add these new routes into your reverse proxy, example in various reverse proxy:

- [NGINX](./companion-nginx.md)
- [Apache2](./companion-apache2.md)
- [Caddy](./companion-caddy.md)
- [Traefik](./companion-traefik.md)
