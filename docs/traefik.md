# Traefik reverse proxy setup

This is a very basic config, assuming that you're using Traefik to manage SSL certificates for you, and Traefik is on the same server as the Invidious and companion container.
Do not forget to replace `<server_name>` with your domain.

      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.invidious.rule=Host(`<server_name>`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.invidious.entrypoints=web-sec"
      - "traefik.http.routers.invidious.tls.certresolver=le"
      - "traefik.http.services.invidious.loadbalancer.server.port=3000"
