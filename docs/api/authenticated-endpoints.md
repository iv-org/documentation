# API - Authenticated endpoints

All endpoints under namespace `/api/v1/auth` require authentication.

Authentication can be in one of two forms:

- A `Cookie: <SID>` header (for logged in users)
- An `Authentication: Bearer <TOKEN>` (recommended)

A new token can be generated from `/authorize_token` with the given parameters:

```
scopes: Comma-separated list of scopes
callback_url: URL to redirect to with generated token
expire: Int64 how long a given token should be valid (in seconds)
```

Each `scope` has the following format:

```
METHOD1;METHOD2...:ENDPOINT(*)?
```

Where `METHOD` can be one of `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`.

An `ENDPOINT` can be any of the documented endpoints below.

Examples:

- `POST:playlists*`: authorizes `POST` methods to _any_ endpoint under `/api/v1/auth/playlists` (`/api/v1/auth/playlists`, `/api/v1/playlists/:id/videos`, etc.)

- `:playlists/*`: authorizes _any_ method to endpoints under `/api/v1/auth/playlists/` (`/api/v1/auth/playlists/:id`, `/api/v1/playlists/:id/videos`, etc.)

- `GET:playlists/IVPAAAAAAA`: authorizes `GET` only to playlist `IVPAAAAAAA`.

- `:preferences`: authorizes _any_ method to `/api/v1/auth/preferences`

- `GET;POST:preferences`: authorizes `GET` or `POST` to `/api/v1/auth/preferences`

When a `callback_url` is specified, after a user has authorized a token with the desired `scopes`, a GET request will be made to the `callback_url` with the token URL-escaped and appended as `token=TOKEN`.

##### GET `/api/v1/auth/feed`

Get subscription feed for the authenticated user.

Parameters:

```
max_results: Int32
page: Int32
```

##### GET `/api/v1/auth/notifications`

Parameters:

```
topics: Array(String) (comma separated: e.g. "UCID1,UCID2) limit of 1000 topics
since: Int64, timestamp
```

Provides an [EventSource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource) for receiving changes from each `topic` in `topics`. Currently the only supported topic-type is `ucid`, which will return an updated video object whenever the given channel uploads a video.

Important to note is that an event will also be sent when a channel _changes_ an already uploaded video, for example changing description or title.

Each event is a JSON object with the same schema as `/api/v1/videos`.

A `debug` topic can also provided which will return a (psuedo-)randomly selected video every minute.

`since` will return all videos uploaded since `TIMESTAMP`, with a limit of the 15 most recent videos from each topic.

More details in [#469](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious/issues/469).
