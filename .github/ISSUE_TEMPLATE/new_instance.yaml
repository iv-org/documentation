        Please consult these two important tutorials:

        - Escaping the YouTube block ([403 errors in playback](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious/issues/4045)): https://docs.invidious.io/ipv6-rotator/
        - Improving the performance and the stability of your public instance: https://docs.invidious.io/improve-public-instance/
        
        It is highly recommended to follow these tutorials because it will allow the instance to stay stable and performant over the long term.
